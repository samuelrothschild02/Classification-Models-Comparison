# Classification-Models-Comparison

### Binary & Multi-Class Classification Analysis

This repository showcases a comparative study of machine learning algorithms for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. It evaluates the efficacy of various models to predict outcomes accurately across different datasets.

### Features

Models Compared: Includes Binary Logistic Regression, Binary Linear SVC, Binary Perceptron, and methods extended to multi-class scenarios.
Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Dataset: Analysis performed on datasets tailored for classification tasks (details within the notebook).
Quick Start

The notebook contains all necessary code for setup, execution, and evaluation of the models. It's designed for easy replication and further exploration.

In addition, for the CS77 Final the code also had to meet certain requirements in Kaggle contests, it passed all accuracy quotas comfortably.
